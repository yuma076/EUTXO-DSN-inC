Be not defeated by the rain
Be not defeated by the wind
Nor be defeated by the snow or the heat of summer
Have a strong body
Be free from desire
Never lose your temper
Always keep a quiet smile
Eat four bowls of brown rice a day
With some miso and a few vegetables
Observe all things carefully, without getting emotional
Understand but never forget
Live quietly in a small thatched hut
In the shade of a pine forest on the plains
If there is a sick child in the east, go and nurse them
If there is a tired mother in the west, go and carry her bundle of rice
If there is someone near death in the south, go and say, "Do not be afraid"
If there is a quarrel or a lawsuit in the north, tell them to leave off such wasteful things
When there is drought, shed tears
When the summer is cold, walk in dismay
Be called a fool by everyone
Neither praised nor thought of as a burden
Such a person
I wish to become
